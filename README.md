# My Portfolio

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Olly. I am a full stack developer and security specialist based in Melbourne, Australia. This is my portfolio and blog, built with Astro. I explain my design decisions for this portfolio in a blog post [here](https://ollymarkey.com/blog/my-portfolio).

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-markey-9a462a247/) or [X](https://x.com/MarkeyOlly).

The project is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ollymarkey/portfolio). Feel free to fork it and use it as a template for your own portfolio!
